# Kata Guidelines

We usually follow the practices listed in our kata meet-ups, unless mentioned otherwise.

We...

## 1. Code in pairs (or mobs) :paw_prints:

> "For an idea to go from your head into the computer it MUST go through someone else's hands"

We work on katas in pairs or groups/mobs, usually in a hybrid of driver/navigator & strong-styled pairing.

One partner (the driver) is at the keyboard, and is sharing their screen if remote. The remaining members navigate - they share intent with the driver, which the driver then translates into code. Every 5-10, we rotate roles.

Read more about pair programming on [Martin Fowler's blog](https://martinfowler.com/articles/on-pair-programming.html).

## 2. Keep tests in the green :vertical_traffic_light:

Run tests frequently and refactor code incrementally, preferring safe refactors (i.e. using the IDE). If tests are red for more than a few minutes, consider reverting to a stable state.

## 3. Commit often :checkered_flag:

Supports the previous principle ("Keep tests in the green") by allowing to revert to a previous good state.

Allows experimentation ("[spike solutions](https://www.jamesshore.com/Agile-Book/spike_solutions.html)") if you or your partner wants to try something out, and then want to revert back to previous state.

Also useful when demoing code to other groups at the meet-up.
